# Smart City Swarm Drones

An autonomous swarm drone system for smart city infrastructure inspection using PX4, Gazebo, ROS2, and AI-based perception.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

This project implements a **swarm-based autonomous drone system** designed to inspect and monitor smart city infrastructure components such as:

- Smart street lights  
- EV charging stations  
- Solar panels  

Instead of relying on a single drone, the system distributes inspection tasks across a fleet of drones (swarm), improving scalability, efficiency, and fault tolerance.

The system operates inside a simulated smart city environment built with **Gazebo**, while drone control and coordination are handled through **PX4**, **ROS2**, and **MAVSDK**.

An AI perception layer is integrated to enable:
- Object detection of infrastructure elements  
- Visual analysis using RGB and depth cameras  
- A foundation for anomaly detection and condition monitoring
